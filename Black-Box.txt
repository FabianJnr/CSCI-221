Black-Box Testing:

1. TEST_1:  This will test the relu function on an empty array. The input is an empty array with length of 0. The expected output is an 
            empty array. I chose this test because, I want to check how the relu function handles an empty array.
            array = [], length = 0

2. TEST_2:  This will test the relu function on an array which has all its elements being greater than 0. The expected output is the same 
            array. I chose this test to check if the relu function really leaves all elements greater than 0 unchanged. 
            array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], length = 8

3. TEST_3:  This will test the relu function on an array with all of its elements less than 0. The expected output is an array with all of
            its elements being 0. I chose this test to see if the relu function correctly replaces all negative elements with zero.
            array = [-1,-2,-3,-4]m length = 4

4. TEST_4:  This test will check the relu function's behavior on an array with a mix of elements greater than and less than 0. The 
            expected output is an array with elements less than 0 replaced with 0. I chose this to test if the relu function replaces 
            elements less than 0, leaving the ones greater than 0.
            array = [-1,-2,-3,-4,5,6,7,8], length = 8

5. TEST_5:  This is to test the relu function on an array containing elements equal to, greater than and less than 0. The expected output
            is an array with all the elements less than zero replaced with 0. I chose this to test if the relu function replaces 
            elements less than 0, leaving the ones greater than and equal to 0. 
            array = [-1,-2,-3,4,5,6,0,0,0], length = 9

6. TEST_6:  This test will check how the relu function behaves on an array containing only zeros. The expected output will be the same array 
            containing all zeros. I chose this to check if the relu function really leaves an array with all zero elements unchanged.
            array = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], length = 7
